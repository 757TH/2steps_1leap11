= Women's rights in peril

[? if anti_women_seen <= 1 : The conservatives and reactionaries are protesting against our earlier reforms that increased rights for women. ?][? if anti_women_seen >= 2 : Once again, the conservatives and reactionaries are protesting against our earlier reforms that increased rights for women. ?] [? if (womens_work = 0 and family_law = 0 and abortion_rights = 0) : They consider increased welfare spending on women and children to be profligate and irresponsible. ?] [? if womens_work >= 1: They claim that our equal workforce policies jeopardize merit-based performance and contribute to the economic decline. ?] [? if family_law >= 0: Our changes to family and inheritance law are decried as government overreach into ostensibly private affairs. ?] [? if abortion_rights >= 1 : The bulk of their objections is, of course, aimed at legalized abortion. ?] They demand a complete rollback of our reforms. What shall we do?

- @vote_yes: Agree to roll back women's rights.
- @vote_no: Stand firm by our earlier reforms.

The women of Germany are shocked by our betrayal! Many of our grassroots members have become disillusioned by the party, and some party branches have begun agitating against the cabinet.

Our coalition partners are shocked by our obstinance! The matter is brought to a Reichstag vote, which narrowly fails. We have saved the women's rights for now, but how long can we keep the wolves at bay?
